  abstract  = {For past 10 years Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) has rapidly grown. Recently not only luxury cars but some entry level cars are equipped with ADAS applications, such as Automated Emergency Braking System (AEBS). The European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) announced its introduction of AEBS test from 2014, which will accelerate the penetration of ADAS in Europe. Also DARPA challenge started from 2004 accelerated the research for autonomous driving. Several OEMs and universities have demonstrated autonomous driving cars. This paper gives a brief survey of technical trend of ADAS and autonomous driving focusing on algorithms actually used for autonomous driving prototype cars.},

  year     = {2014},
  abstract = {SAE international's J3016 provides a common taxonomy and definitions for automated driving in order to simplify communication and facilitate collaboration within technical and policy domains. It defines more than a dozen key terms, including those italicized below, and provides full descriptions and examples for each level. The report's six levels of driving automation span from no automation to full automation. A key distinction is between level 2, where the human driver performs part of the dynamic driving task, and level 3, where the automated driving system performs the entire dynamic driving task. These levels are descriptive rather than normative and technical rather than legal. They imply no particular order of market introduction. Elements indicate minimum rather than maximum system capabilities for each level. A particular vehicle may have multiple driving automation features such that it could operate at different levels depending upon the feature(s) that are engaged. System refers to the driver assistance system, combination of driver assistance systems, or automated driving system. Excluded are warning and momentary intervention systems, which do not automate any part of the dynamic driving task on a sustained basis and therefore do not change the human driver's role in performing the dynamic driving task.},

  month     = {nov},
  year      = {2014},
  abstract  = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC), a driver assistance system that controls longitudinal motion, has been introduced in consumer cars in 1995. A next milestone is highly automated driving (HAD), a system that automates both longitudinal and lateral motion. We investigated the effects of ACC and HAD on drivers' workload and situation awareness through a meta-analysis and narrative review of simulator and on-road studies. Based on a total of 32 studies, the unweighted mean self-reported workload was 43.5% for manual driving, 38.6% for ACC driving, and 22.7% for HAD (0% = minimum, 100 = maximum on the NASA Task Load Index or Rating Scale Mental Effort). Based on 12 studies, the number of tasks completed on an in-vehicle display relative to manual driving (100%) was 112% for ACC and 261% for HAD. Drivers of a highly automated car, and to a lesser extent ACC drivers, are likely to pick up tasks that are unrelated to driving. Both ACC and HAD can result in improved situation awareness compared to manual driving if drivers are motivated or instructed to detect objects in the environment. However, if drivers are engaged in non-driving tasks, situation awareness deteriorates for ACC and HAD compared to manual driving. The results of this review are consistent with the hypothesis that, from a Human Factors perspective, HAD is markedly different from ACC driving, because the driver of a highly automated car has the possibility, for better or worse, to divert attention to secondary tasks, whereas an ACC driver still has to attend to the roadway.},

Previous studies have revealed problems with driving performance in situations with automation failures and attributed this to drivers being out-of-the-loop. It was therefore hypothesized that driving performance is safer with lower than with higher levels of automation. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that driving performance would be affected by the extent of the automation failure. A moving base driving simulator was used. The design contained semi-automated and highly automated driving combined with complete, severe, and moderate deceleration failures. In total the study involved 36 participants. The results indicate that driving performance degrades when the level of automation increases. Furthermore, it is indicated that car drivers are worse at handling complete than partial deceleration failures.},

  abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that driver distraction is a leading cause of vehicle crashes and incidents. In particular, increased use of so-called in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and partially autonomous driving assistance systems (PADAS) have raised important and growing safety concerns. Thus, detecting the driver's state is of paramount importance, to adapt IVIS and PADAS accordingly, therefore avoiding or mitigating their possible negative effects. The purpose of this paper is to show a method for the nonintrusive and real-time detection of visual distraction, using vehicle dynamics data and without using the eye-tracker data as inputs to classifiers. Specifically, we present and compare different models that are based on well-known machine learning (ML) methods. Data for training the models were collected using a static driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific secondary task [i.e., a surrogate visual research task (SURT)] while driving. Different training methods, model characteristics, and feature selection criteria have been compared. Based on our results, using a support vector machine (SVM) has outperformed all the other ML methods, providing the highest classification rate for most of the subjects. Potential applications of this paper include the design of an adaptive IVIS and of a “smarter” PADAS.},

To develop interface solutions that adequately support drivers in this new role, this study proposes and evaluates an assessment framework that allows designers to evaluate driver-support within relevant real-world scenarios. Aspects identified as requiring assessment in terms of driver-support within the proposed framework are Accident Avoidance, gained Situation Awareness (SA) and Concept Acceptance. Measurement techniques selected to operationalise these aspects and the associated framework are pilot-tested with twenty-four participants in a driving simulator experiment. The objective of the test is to determine the reliability of the applied measurements for the assessment of the framework and whether the proposed framework is effective in predicting the level of support offered by the concepts. Based on the congruency between measurement scores produced in the test and scores with predefined differences in concept-support, this study demonstrates the framework's reliability. A remaining concern is the framework's weak sensitivity to small differences in offered support. The article concludes that applying the framework is especially advantageous for evaluating early design phases and can successfully contribute to the efficient development of driver's in-control and safe means of operating partially automated vehicles.},

This emerg-ing technology also has far-reaching applications and implications beyond all current expectations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the relevant literature and explores a broad spectrum of issues from safety to machine ethics. An indispensable part of a prospective AV development is communication over cars and infrastructure (connected vehicles). A major knowledge gap exists in AV technology with respect to routing behaviors. Connected-vehicle technology provides a great opportunity to imple-ment an efficient and intelligent routing system. To this end, we propose a conceptual navigation model based on a fleet of AVs that are centrally dispatched over a network seeking system optimization. This study contributes to the literature on two fronts: (i) it attempts to shed light on future opportunities as well as possible hurdles associated with AV technology; and (ii) it conceptualizes a navigation model for the AV which leads to highly efficient traffic circulations.},

Currently, there is a need for individualization of advanced DAS with the aim of improving safety, security and comfort of the driver. In particular, the need to adapt the vehicle to individual preferences and requirements of the driver is an important research focus. In this work, an individualized and non-intrusive monitoring system for real-time driver support is proposed. The kernel of the system is a driver identification module based on driving behavior signals and a high-performance machine learning technique. The scheme is suitable for the development of single-chip embedded systems. Moreover, most of the measurement units used in this research are nowadays available in commercial vehicles, so the deployment of the system can be performed with minimal additional cost. Experimental results using a reduced set of features are very encouraging. Identification rates greater than 75% are obtained for a working set of 11 drivers, 86% for five-driver groups, 88% for four-driver groups, and 90% for three-driver groups.},

Hence, these devices are a convenient and practical platform to use as a smart sensor and driving assistance for intelligent vehicles. This paper presents two of the broad range of practical applications that regards this approach: I) A vehicle data recorder and II) A road segmentation application. Furthermore, other applications are going to be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {This contribution provides a review of fundamental goals, development and future perspectives of driver assistance systems. Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research fields.},

  abstract = {Driver drowsiness and distraction are two main reasons for traffic accidents and the related financial losses. Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network's (VANET's) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis)advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.},

  abstract  = {Real-time abnormal driving behaviors monitoring is a corner stone to improving driving safety. Existing works on driving behaviors monitoring using smartphones only provide a coarsegrained result, i.e. distinguishing abnormal driving behaviors from normal ones. To improve drivers' awareness of their driving habits so as to prevent potential car accidents, we need to consider a finegrained monitoring approach, which not only detects abnormal driving behaviors but also identifies specific types of abnormal driving behaviors, i.e. Weaving, Swerving, Sideslipping, Fast U-turn, Turning with a wide radius and Sudden braking. Through empirical studies of the 6-month driving traces collected from real driving environments, we find that all of the six types of driving behaviors have their unique patterns on acceleration and orientation. Recognizing this observation, we further propose a finegrained abnormal Driving behavior Detection and iDentification system, D3, to perform real-time high-accurate abnormal driving behaviors monitoring using smartphone sensors. By extracting unique features from readings of smartphones' accelerometer and orientation sensor, we first identify sixteen representative features to capture the patterns of driving behaviors. Then, a machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is employed to train the features and output a classifier model which conducts fine-grained identification. From results of extensive experiments with 20 volunteers driving for another 4 months in real driving environments, we show that D3 achieves an average total accuracy of 95.36%. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Specifically, driving behaviors could be monitored online to determine the crash risk and provide warning information to the driver via their ADAS. In this paper, we focus on aggressiveness as one of the potential causes of traffic accidents. We demonstrate that aggressiveness can be detected by monitoring external driving signals such as lateral and longitudinal accelerations and speed. We model aggressiveness as a linear filter operating on these signals, thus scaling their probability distribution functions and modifying their mean value, standard deviation, and dynamic range. Next, we proceed to validate this model via an experiment, conducted under real driving conditions, involving ten different drivers, traveling a route with five different types of road sections, subject to both smooth and aggressive behaviors. The obtained results confirm the validity of the model of aggressiveness. In addition, they show the generality of this model and its applicability to specific driving signals (speed, longitudinal, and lateral accelerations), every single driver, and every road type. Finally, we build a classifier capable of detecting aggressive behavior from the driving signal. This classifier achieves a success rate up to 92%. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Applying wireless access technology in vehicular environments has led to the improvement of road safety and a reduction in the number of fatalities caused by road accidents through development of road safety applications and facilitation of information sharing between moving vehicles regarding the road. This paper focuses on developing a novel and nonintrusive driver behavior detection system using a context-aware system in VANETs to detect abnormal behaviors exhibited by drivers and to warn other vehicles on the road to prevent accidents from happening. A five-layer context-aware architecture is proposed, which is able to collect contextual information about the driving environment, to perform reasoning about certain and uncertain contextual information, and to react upon that information. A probabilistic model based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) in real time, inferring four types of driving behavior (normal, drunk, reckless, and fatigue) by combining contextual information about the driver, the vehicle, and the environment, is presented. The dynamic behavior model can capture the static and the temporal aspects related to the behavior of the driver, thus leading to robust and accurate behavior detection. The evaluation of behavior detection using synthetic data proves the validity of our model and the importance of including contextual information about the driver, the vehicle, and the environment.

A number of studies have investigated driving style, but they often rely on the use of self-reports or simulators, which are not suitable for the real-time, continuous, automated assessment and feedback on the road. In order to understand and model aggressive driving style, we construct an in-vehicle sensing platform that uses a smartphone instead of using heavyweight, expensive systems. Utilizing additional cheap sensors, our sensing platform can collect useful information about vehicle movement, maneuvering and steering wheel movement. We use this data and apply machine learning to build a driver model that evaluates drivers' driving styles based on a number of driving-related features. From a naturalistic data collection from 22 drivers for 3 weeks, we analyzed the characteristics of drivers who have an aggressive driving style. Our model classified those drivers with an accuracy of 90.5% (violation-class) and 81% (questionnaire-class). We describe how, in future work, our model can be used to provide real-time feedback to drivers using only their current smartphone.},

  abstract  = {Driving risk varies substantially among drivers. Identifying and predicting high-risk drivers will greatly benefit the development of proactive driver education programs and safety countermeasures. The objective of this study is twofold: (1) to identify factors associated with individual driver risk and (2) predict high-risk drivers using demographic, personality, and driving characteristic data. The 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study was used for methodology development and application. A negative binomial regression model was adopted to identify significant risk factors. The results indicated that the driver's age, personality, and critical incident rate had significant impacts on crash and near-crash risk. For the second objective, drivers were classified into three risk groups based on crash and near-crash rate using a K-mean cluster method. The cluster analysis identified approximately 6% of drivers as high-risk drivers, with average crash and near-crash (CNC) rate of 3.95 per 1000 miles traveled, 12% of drivers as moderate-risk drivers (average CNC rate = 1.75), and 84% of drivers as low-risk drivers (average CNC rate = 0.39). Two logistic models were developed to predict the high- and moderate-risk drivers. Both models showed high predictive powers with area under the curve values of 0.938 and 0.930 for the receiver operating characteristic curves. This study concluded that crash and near-crash risk for individual drivers is associated with critical incident rate, demographic, and personality characteristics. Furthermore, the critical incident rate is an effective predictor for high-risk drivers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This often leads to possible accidents. In order to reduce road traffic accidents, one domain which requires to be focused on is driving behaviour. This paper proposes three algorithms which detect driving events using motion sensors embedded on a smartphone since it is easily accessible and widely available in the market. More importantly, the proposed algorithms classify whether or not these events are aggressive based on raw data from various on board sensors on a smartphone. In addition, one of the outstanding features of the proposed algorithm is the ability to fine tune and adjust its sensitivity level to suit any given application domain appropriately. Initial experimental results reveal that the pattern matching algorithm outperforms the rule-based algorithm for driving events in both lateral and longitudinal movements where a high percentage of detection rate has been obtained for 11 out of 12 types of driving events. In addition, a trade-off between the detection rate and false alarm rate has been demonstrated under a range of algorithm settings in order to illustrate the proposed algorithm's flexibility.},

  abstract = {Detection of driver aggressiveness is a significant method in terms of safe driving. Every year, a vast number of traffic accidents occur due to aggressive driving behaviour. These traffic accidents cause fatalities, severe disorders and huge economical cost. Therefore, detection of driver aggressiveness could help in reducing the number of traffic accidents by warning related authorities to take necessary precautions. In this work, a novel method is introduced in order to detect driver aggressiveness on vehicle. The proposed method is based on the fusion of visual and sensor features to characterize related driving session and to decide whether the session involves aggressive driving behaviour. Visual information is used to detect road lines and vehicle images, whereas sensor information provides data such as vehicle speed and engine speed. Both information is used to obtain feature vectors which represent a driving session. These feature vectors are obtained by modelling time series data by Gaussian distributions. An SVM classifier is utilized to classify the feature vectors in order for aggressiveness decision. The proposed system is tested by real traffic data, and it achieved an aggressive driving detection rate of 93.1 %.},

Due to their increasing market penetration, there is a potential for the development of distributed sensing platforms. In particular, over the last few years there has been an increasing interest in monitoring vehicles and driving data, aiming to identify risky driving maneuvers and to improve driver efficiency. Such a driver profiling system can be useful in fleet management, insurance premium adjustment, fuel consumption optimization or CO2 emission reduction. In this paper, we analyze how smartphone sensors can be used to identify driving maneuvers and propose SenseFleet, a driver profile platform that is able to detect risky driving events independently from the mobile device and vehicle. A fuzzy system is used to compute a score for the different drivers using real-time context information like route topology or weather conditions. To validate our platform, we present an evaluation study considering multiple drivers along a predefined path. The results show that our platform is able to accurately detect risky driving events and provide a representative score for each individual driver.},

abstract = {The availability of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), for safety and well-being, is becoming increasingly important for avoiding traffic accidents caused by fatigue, stress, or distractions. For this reason, automatic identification of a driver from among a group of various drivers (i.e. real-time driver identification) is a key factor in the development of ADAS, mainly when the driver's comfort and security is also to be taken into account. The main focus of this work is the development of embedded electronic systems for in-vehicle deployment of driver identification models. We developed a hybrid model based on artificial neural networks (ANN), and cepstral feature extraction techniques, able to recognize the driving style of different drivers. Results obtained show that the system is able to perform real-time driver identification using non-intrusive driving behavior signals such as brake pedal signals and gas pedal signals. The identification of a driver from within groups with a reduced number of drivers yields promising identification rates (e.g. 3-driver group yield 84.6 %). However, real-time development of ADAS requires very fast electronic systems. To this end, an FPGA-based hardware coprocessor for acceleration of the neural classifier has been developed. The coprocessor core is able to compute the whole ANN in less than 4 $\mu$s.},

However, traditional methods mainly rely on handcrafted features, which limit machine learning algorithms to achieve a better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning solution to this problem, which could be the first attempt of extending deep learning to driving behavior analysis based on GPS data. The proposed approach can effectively extract high level and interpretable features describing complex driving patterns. It also requires significantly less human experience and work.

abstract = {As vehicle maneuver data becomes abundant for assisted or autonomous driving, their implication of privacy invasion/leakage has become an increasing concern. In particular, the surface for fingerprinting a driver will expand significantly if the driver's identity can be linked with the data collected from his mobile or wearable devices which are widely deployed worldwide and have increasing sensing capabilities. In line with this trend, this paper investigates a fast emerging driving data source that has driver's privacy implications. We first show that such privacy threats can be materialized via any mobile device with IMUs (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer). We then present Dri-Fi (Driver Fingerprint), a driving data analytic engine that can fingerprint the driver with vehicle turn(s). Dri-Fi achieves this based on IMUs data taken only during the vehicle's turn(s). Such an approach expands the attack surface significantly compared to existing driver fingerprinting schemes. From this data, Dri-Fi extracts three new features --- acceleration along the end-of-turn axis, its deviation, and the deviation of the yaw rate --- and exploits them to identify the driver. Our extensive evaluation shows that an adversary equipped with Dri-Fi can correctly fingerprint the driver within just one turn with 74.1{\%}, 83.5{\%}, and 90.8{\%} accuracy across 12, 8, and 5 drivers --- typical of an immediate family or close-friends circle --- respectively. Moreover, with measurements on more than one turn, the adversary can achieve up to 95.3{\%}, 95.4{\%}, and 96.6{\%} accuracy across 12, 8, and 5 drivers, respectively.},

Different drivers vary in how they hit the gas and brake pedals, how they turn the steering wheel, and how much following distance they keep to follow a vehicle safely and comfortably. In this paper, we model such driving behaviors as car-following and pedal operation patterns. The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle. Experimental results show that the driver model based on the spectral features of pedal operation signals efficiently models driver individual differences and achieves an identification rate of 76.8{\%} for a field test with 276 drivers, resulting in a relative error reduction of 55{\%} over driver models that use raw pedal operation signals without spectral analysis},

The need to adapt the vehicle to the preferences and requirements of the driver leads to the development of individualized ADAS. Automatic identification of the driver is a key factor in the design of these systems. In this work, a driver identification model with impostor detection capability is proposed. This approach is based on non-intrusive information from driving behavior signals, and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network. The performance of the system is evaluated on the basis of groups of different number of known drivers, and possible impostor drivers. Identification rates are greater than 80% for every group category tested, and still above 90% for groups of two and three drivers. The impostor detection rate is above 80% when the car has a single genuine driver. This rate decays in inverse proportion to the number of authorized drivers, but it is greater than 50% in all cases.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a driver identification method that is based on the driving behavior signals that are observed while the driver is following another vehicle. Driving behavior signals, such as the use of the accelerator pedal, brake pedal, vehicle velocity, and distance from the vehicle in front, are measured using a driving simulator. We compared the identification rate obtained using different identification models and different features. As a result, we found the nonparametric models is better than the parametric models. Also, the driver's operation signals were found to be better than road environment signals and car behavior signals. The identification rate for thirty driver using actual vehicle driving in a city area was 73%.},
